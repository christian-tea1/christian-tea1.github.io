<h2> Article 5 </h2>
<p>Toxicity in gaming is when a person is mean to another person when gaming, not just being mean though, but it’s being so abruptly “toxic” for the smallest or no reason at all. It's important to understand this so the ability to prevent or combat it is more possible. I personally believe the best way to combat this is through the use of A.I. to analyze and ban these people who show toxicity.

<h2> Article 1&2 </h2>
<p>
PT drivers make a poor attempt to criticize the fps known as Rainbow Six Siege. Instead of
criticizing R6’s (Rainbow Six Siege) biggest problem which is cheaters, PT drivers choose to
pinpoint they’re lack of a single player mode. To be blunt, it doesn't make any sense to have a
single player mode. Not one mainstream competitive fps has a single player mode, Valorant?
No, Apex Legends? No, CSGO? No! Siege is not meant to be single player nor was it ever,
Siege is a game only won with the best teammates and chemistry, and the most precise of
communication.
