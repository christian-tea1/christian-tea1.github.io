          <h3>The Basics
</h3>
          <p>Now that you know the layout of the game it’s time I explain in detail, Each round starts off with a buy phase, if you’re unfamiliar with this, think of it as a preparation phase, where each team can’t kill each other and you gear up and buy abilities, weapons, or any other utility. It’s also important to note that each weapon and ability cost a different amount, for example the starting pistols are cheap and are the weakest weapons of the bunch, on the other end, the rifles are gonna be some of the most expensive and most powerful of the weapons, the variety of weapons varies from pistols, to shotguns, rifles, submachine guns, and even sniper rifles. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>After the buy phase the real round commences, each team makes their way to the center of the map where the “ A and B zones are” either team wiping out anyone that gets in the way. These zones are locations where the spike is able to be planted, taking 7 seconds to plant or defuse. Naturally either team will conflict in these zones or areas that lead to these zones. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Useful Strategies &nbsp;</h3>
          <p>Naturally there are to be strategies to an fps as complex as this one, to startoff I'll tell you about the best guns. When the game starts you only get 800 credits to spend, the best way to go about this is to keep the starter pistol and buy either light armor, or preferably nothing at all. After the first round you'll get a more credits, and even more if won the round previous. I suggest with the credits you have now to buy the spectre, an accurate high fire rate submachine gun and some heavy armor to pair with. I heavily suggest to do the same thing the next 1-2 rounds as well as buy a couple of your abilities. After those first couple of rounds you should either buy a Vandal, or a Phantom. Both are Assault Rifles, however the Phantom is more accurate and the Vandal does more damage, there both evenly good so the choice is really up to you. To combo your assault Rifle, you should of course buy heavy armor again. And I strongly suggest you continue to buy these same weapons until you switch sides...unless you want to upgrade to a snipe rifle, the most risky yet rewarding weapon in the game.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Basic but useful is to make sure your team doesn't have more then 3 maybe 4 people pushing one area. You should always have people to watch the flank and play the flank. As well as make sure your team has at least 1 of each class on the team. The most important tip of alll however is to play with and off your team, give them callouts, And play with them. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Agent Overview</strong></h2>
          <p>Before the game starts there’s a pick phase where everyone selects the Agent they want to play. The Agents are separated into three different classes. &nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12">
          <h2>Duelist&nbsp;</h2>
          <p>The first class is the duelist class. They generally are going to be the first ones to get kills or the first to get killed, the person playing this class is going to want to be the best gunskill wise, as they are going to be getting the most action. &nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12">
          <h2> Initiator&nbsp;</h2>
          <p>The class following this is Initiator, their role is to gather intel and assist on the team push. Sentinels are going to be laid back defenders there at the root of the team. &nbsp;</p>

        <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-12">
          <h2>Controller</h2>
          <p>And last but not least is the controller class, they help block off parts of the site and will offer the most support to the team.</p>
